# Conversant ConcurrentQueue and Disruptor BlockingQueue

Disruptor is the highest performing intra-thread transfer mechanism available in Java.  Conversant Disruptor is the highest performing implementation of this type of ring buffer queue because it has almost no overhead and it exploits a particularly simple design. 

# Getting Started
